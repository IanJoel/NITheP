### The Square Kilometre Array and its Science

This lecture gives an introduction to radio telescopes and interferometry. It describes the [Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope](www.skatelescope.org) and some of the [key science areas](https://www.skatelescope.org/science/) that will be addressed by this new instrument. It goes on to explain how radio interferometers make measurements of the sky. 

#### Reading material:

* [Chapter 3.7](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch3.html#S7) of the [Essential Radio Astronomy](https://science.nrao.edu/opportunities/courses/era) course by Jim Condon & Scott Ransom provides a good introduction to interferometry. (Personally I still like [the earlier version of this course](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/ERA_old.shtml).)
