# Lectures

### Lecture 1: The Square Kilometre Array and its Science [[link](https://github.com/as595/NITheP/blob/master/LECTURES/SquareKilometreArray.pdf)]

This lecture gives an introduction to radio telescopes and interferometry. It describes the [Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope](www.skatelescope.org) and some of the [key science areas](https://www.skatelescope.org/science/) that will be addressed by this new instrument. It goes on to explain how radio interferometers make measurements of the sky. 

#### Reading material:

* [Chapter 3.7](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch3.html#S7) of the [Essential Radio Astronomy](https://science.nrao.edu/opportunities/courses/era) course by Jim Condon & Scott Ransom provides a good introduction to interferometry. (Personally I still like [the earlier version of this course](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/ERA_old.shtml).)

* [Chapter 3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-44431-4_3) of [Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-44431-4) by Thompson, Moran & Swenson gives a more detailed explanation of the interferometer response.

### Lecture 2: Indirect Imaging in the SKA Era

This lecture gives an introduction to making images using data from radio interferometers and describes why this is computationally challenging for the SKA. 

#### Reading material:

* [Chapter 10](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-44431-4_10) of [Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-44431-4) by Thompson, Moran & Swenson gives an introduction to interferometric imaging.

* [This paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2005ASPC..347...86C) by Tim Cornwell talks about w-projection for wide field imaging.
